# Console-Finances

## User Story

As a developing UX/UI web developer, I WANT to create JavaScript code that analyzes the records (a dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses.), to calculate a number of key metrics and print them to the Console.

## Acceptance Criteria



* total number of months included in the dataset.
* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
    You will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
    (Total/Number of months)
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

When you open your code in the browser your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86 <br>
Total: $38382578 <br>
Average  Change: $-2315.12 <br>
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159) <br>
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167) <br>


Your final code should print the analysis to the console.
